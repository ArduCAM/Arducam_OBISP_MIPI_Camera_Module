# Arducam_OBISP_MIPI_Camera_Module

Arducam OBISP project is to address the problem of lacking ISP support for the RAW sensor, it has On Board ISP as the name implies which has dedicated hardware processor and not relay on the backend processorâ€™s processing capability. With the OBISP camera, users can use better cameras than those natively supported cameras like OV5647, IMX219, IMX477 on Arduino, Raspberry pi, and Jetson Nano without struggling with the ISP things. The first two released OBISP cameras are 13MP AR1335 high-resolution camera and 2MP AR0230 HDR camera. And Sony starvis IMX290, IMX327 camera will come up very soon.

# Driver Support
This repository only provides the driver and camera software tools for Raspberry pi. This driver is based on Arducam Pivariety Project.

Pivariety is a Raspberry Pi V4L2 kernel camera driver framework which can support any MIPI cameras Arducam provides but natively not supported by the Raspberry Pi. If you have native Raspberry pi camera modules like OV5647, IMX219 and IMX477, please do not use this driver. 

A single-camera driver for all is the main goal of Pivariety project, the user doesn't need to develop their own camera driver for Nvidia Jetson boards and even more, user can switch between different Arducam cameras without switching camera driver. Software compatibility for Jetvariety V4L2 driver is also another consideration for this project. 

For Jetson Nano/Xavier driver, please use the [Jetvariety driver](https://github.com/ArduCAM/MIPI_Camera/tree/master/Jetson/Jetvariety/driver) for OBISP cameras.

Current driver supports the following kerner version, for other kernel please send us request for adding support or source code to compile by yourself.
* 4.19.113-v7+
* 4.19.118-v7+
* 4.19.118-v7I+
* 5.4.42-v7+
